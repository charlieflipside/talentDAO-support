This repo holds scripts to help friends at talentDAO!


# Reproduce Analysis

All analysis is reproducible using the R programming language. You'll need (1) an shroomDK API key to copy our SQL queries and extract data from the [FlipsideCrypto data app](https://next.flipsidecrypto.xyz/); and (2) renv to get the exact package versions we used.

## shroomDK

shroomDK is an R package that accesses the FlipsideCrypto REST API; it is also available for Python. You pass SQL code as a string to our API and get up to 1M rows of data back!

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.com/shroomdk-sdk/get-started) and get your free API Key today.

## renv

renv is a package manager for the R programming language. It ensures analysis is fully reproducible by tracking the exact package versions used in the analysis.

`install.packages('renv')`

## Instructions

To replicate this analysis please do the following:

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Save your API key into a .txt file as 'api_key.txt' (this exact naming allows the provided .gitignore to ignore your key and keep it off github).
3.  Open the `talentDAO` R Project file in your R IDE (we recommend, RStudio).
4.  Confirm you have renv installed.
5.  Restore the R environment using `renv::restore()` while in the `talentDAO` R Project.
6.  You can now run `repscore_snapshot_nft_mints.R`.

If any errors arise, double check you have saved your API key in the expected file name and format.
